* Description
A basic app that shows how to use msw with graphql in a React app.

** Steps
#+begin_src sh
npx create-next-app next-msw-graphql-app

cd next-msw-graphql-app
pnpm i -D msw msw-storybook-addon @storybook/react
pnpm i graphql @apollo/client

npx storybook@latest init
npx msw init ./public
#+end_src

** Usage Patterns
*** Pattern 1: Component-level Query
- see Hello.tsx, Hello.stories.tsx
- The data is only needed by this component
- The query is simple
- You don't need to share the data with other components

*** Pattern 2: Custom Hook
- see Hello2.tsx, Hello2.stories.tsx
- Reuse the query logic across multiple components
- Separate data fetching concerns
- Add additional data transformation logic

*** Pattern 2: Context Provider
- see Hello3.tsx, Hello3.stories.tsx
- The data needs to be shared across many components
- You want to avoid prop drilling
- You need to manage global state
